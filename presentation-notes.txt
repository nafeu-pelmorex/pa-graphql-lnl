2. What is GraphQL?

Graph -> thinking of a problem in terms of nodes and edges
QL -> query language (a way of asking for data)

GraphQL -> a way of asking for data in terms of nodes and edges

4. Why should you care?

It replaces REST Apis

- the cool kids are using it: Facebook, Github, Paypal, Product Hunt, Shopify, and many more
- it can be used in conjunction with existing technology
- it claims to be highly performant, more maintainable, more scalable and more efficient in place of REST

Built by Facebook in 2012, released publicly in 2015

5. Goodbye Monolith

- the industry is moving towards microservices and hexagonal architecture over monolithic architecture
- we have a huge variation in experiences now (mobile, tablet, IOT device, desktop, voice assistant) all querying the same resources
- we have Third Party APIs that do certain challenging things really well so that we don't have to anymore
  - Twilio: handles texting & automated voice calls from your apps
  - Braintree: handles monetary transactions
  - Auth0: handles authentication and user account management
  - Goole/Amazon/IBM/Microsoft Cloud: various AI related

We want to demonstrate how graphql can be used to replace REST apis (with new Graph API)

RecipesAPI => Flask App (Python)
FridgeAPI => Express App (Node.js)
MealsAPI => GraphQL API Gateway (Node.js)

Questions to Answer:

- Difference between REST and GraphQL

The core difference between GraphQL and REST can be boiled down as follows:

REST has a set of endpoints that each return fixed data structures
GraphQL has a single endpoint that returns flexible data structures

- What is monolithic architecture?
- What are microservices?
- What are advantages of monolith versus microservices?
